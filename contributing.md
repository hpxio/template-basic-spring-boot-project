# CONTRIBUTING TEMPLATE

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, kindly follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes, this includes new environment variables,  
   exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Add appropriate details about the work in changelog, info, api-info and any other documents
   that may represent the changes.
4. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
   
## Commit Log Convention
The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

* **fix:** a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with [PATCH](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
* **feat:** a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with [MINOR](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning).
* **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with [MAJOR](http://semver.org/#summary) in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
* types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) (based on the the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
